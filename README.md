## Getting Started

### Requirements

This library supports the following tooling versions:

- Node.js: 20 or higher

### Installation

Using [npm](https://npmjs.org) in your project directory run the following command:

```bash
npm install @auth0/myorganization-js
```

### Configure the SDK

The MyOrganization client allows you to manage Auth0 organizations, including members, roles, and domains.

Initialize your client with a domain and token supplier:

```typescript
import { MyOrganizationClient } from "@auth0/myorganization-js";

const client = new MyOrganizationClient({
    domain: "{YOUR_TENANT_AND_REGION}.auth0.com",
    token: "YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN", // or use a token supplier function
});
```

#### Using a Token Supplier

For dynamic token retrieval (recommended for production):

```typescript
import { MyOrganizationClient } from "@auth0/myorganization-js";

const client = new MyOrganizationClient({
    domain: "{YOUR_TENANT_AND_REGION}.auth0.com",
    token: async ({ scope }) => {
        // Fetch token with required scopes
        return await getAccessToken({
            scope: `openid profile email ${scope}`,
        });
    },
});
```

#### Using a Custom Fetcher

For advanced authentication scenarios:

```typescript
import { MyOrganizationClient } from "@auth0/myorganization-js";

const client = new MyOrganizationClient({
    domain: "{YOUR_TENANT_AND_REGION}.auth0.com",
    fetcher: async (url, init, authParams) => {
        const token = await getAccessToken({ scope: authParams?.scope });
        return fetch(url, {
            ...init,
            headers: {
                ...init?.headers,
                Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`,
            },
        });
    },
});
```

### Server-Side Authentication

For server-side applications, you can use the client credentials flow with a helper function that automatically handles token management:

#### Using Client Credentials with Client Secret

```typescript
import { createMyOrganizationClientWithClientCredentials } from "@auth0/myorganization-js/server";

const client = createMyOrganizationClientWithClientCredentials(
    {
        domain: "{YOUR_TENANT_AND_REGION}.auth0.com",
    },
    {
        clientId: "YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
        clientSecret: "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET",
        organization: "org_123456789",
    },
);
```

#### Using Client Credentials with Private Key Assertion

For enhanced security using private key JWT:

```typescript
import { createMyOrganizationClientWithClientCredentials } from "@auth0/myorganization-js/server";

const client = createMyOrganizationClientWithClientCredentials(
    {
        domain: "{YOUR_TENANT_AND_REGION}.auth0.com",
    },
    {
        clientId: "YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
        clientAssertionSigningKey: "YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY",
        organization: "org_123456789",
    },
);
```

#### Manual Token Provider Setup

For more control, you can manually configure the token provider:

```typescript
import { MyOrganizationClient, ClientCredentialsTokenProvider } from "@auth0/myorganization-js/server";

const tokenProvider = new ClientCredentialsTokenProvider({
    domain: "{YOUR_TENANT_AND_REGION}.auth0.com",
    clientId: "YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
    clientSecret: "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET",
    organization: "org_123456789",
    audience: "https://api.example.com", // optional custom audience
});

const client = new MyOrganizationClient({
    domain: "{YOUR_TENANT_AND_REGION}.auth0.com",
    tokenProvider,
});
```

**Security Warning**: Server-side authentication methods should only be used in secure server environments where client secrets and private keys can be safely stored. Never expose these credentials in browser or SPA applications.

## Request and Response Types

The SDK exports all request and response types as TypeScript interfaces. You can import them directly:

```typescript
import { MyOrganizationClient, MyOrganization } from "@auth0/myorganization-js";

const client = new MyOrganizationClient({
    domain: "{YOUR_TENANT_AND_REGION}.auth0.com",
    token: "YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN",
});

// Use the request type
const request: MyOrganization.CreateOrganizationDomainRequestContent = {
    domain: "acme.com",
};

await client.organization.domains.create(request);
```

### Key Classes

## Exception Handling

When the API returns a non-success status code (4xx or 5xx response), a subclass of the following error will be thrown:

```typescript
import { MyOrganizationClient, MyOrganizationError } from "@auth0/myorganization-js";

const client = new MyOrganizationClient({
    domain: "{YOUR_TENANT_AND_REGION}.auth0.com",
    token: "YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN",
});

try {
    await client.organization.domains.create({
        domain: "acme.com",
    });
} catch (err) {
    if (err instanceof MyOrganizationError) {
        console.log(err.statusCode);
        console.log(err.message);
        console.log(err.body);
        console.log(err.rawResponse);
    }
}
```

## Pagination

Some list endpoints are paginated. You can manually iterate page-by-page:

```typescript
import { MyOrganizationClient } from "@auth0/myorganization-js";

const client = new MyOrganizationClient({
    domain: "{YOUR_TENANT_AND_REGION}.auth0.com",
    token: "YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN",
});

let page = await client.organization.members.list({
    take: 10,
});

// Process first page
console.log(page.data);

// Get next pages
while (page.hasNextPage()) {
    page = await page.getNextPage();
    console.log(page.data);
}
```

## Advanced

### Additional Headers

If you would like to send additional headers as part of the request, use the `headers` request option:

```typescript
const response = await client.organization.domains.create(
    {
        domain: "acme.com",
    },
    {
        headers: {
            "X-Custom-Header": "custom value",
        },
    },
);
```

### Additional Query String Parameters

If you would like to send additional query string parameters as part of the request, use the `queryParams` request option:

```typescript
const response = await client.organization.domains.create(
    {
        domain: "acme.com",
    },
    {
        queryParams: {
            customQueryParamKey: "custom query param value",
        },
    },
);
```

### Retries

The SDK is instrumented with automatic retries with exponential backoff. A request will be retried as long as the request is deemed retryable and the number of retry attempts has not grown larger than the configured retry limit (default: 2).

A request is deemed retryable when any of the following HTTP status codes is returned:

- [408](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/408) (Timeout)
- [429](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/429) (Too Many Requests)
- [5XX](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/500) (Internal Server Errors)

Use the `maxRetries` request option to configure this behavior:

```typescript
const response = await client.organization.domains.create(
    {
        domain: "acme.com",
    },
    {
        maxRetries: 0, // override maxRetries at the request level
    },
);
```

### Timeouts

The SDK defaults to a 60 second timeout. Use the `timeoutInSeconds` option to configure this behavior:

```typescript
const response = await client.organization.domains.create(
    {
        domain: "acme.com",
    },
    {
        timeoutInSeconds: 30, // override timeout to 30s
    },
);
```

### Aborting Requests

The SDK allows users to abort requests at any point by passing in an abort signal:

```typescript
const controller = new AbortController();
const response = await client.organization.domains.create(
    {
        domain: "acme.com",
    },
    {
        abortSignal: controller.signal,
    },
);
controller.abort(); // aborts the request
```

### Access Raw Response Data

The SDK provides access to raw response data, including headers, through the `.withRawResponse()` method. The `.withRawResponse()` method returns a promise that results to an object with a `data` and a `rawResponse` property:

```typescript
const { data, rawResponse } = await client.organization.domains
    .create({
        domain: "acme.com",
    })
    .withRawResponse();

console.log(data);
console.log(rawResponse.headers["X-My-Header"]);
```

### Runtime Compatibility

The SDK works in the following runtimes:

- Node.js 20 or higher
- Vercel
- Cloudflare Workers
- Deno v1.25+
- Bun 1.0+
- React Native
